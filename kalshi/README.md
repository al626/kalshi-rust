## Rust Wrapper for the Kalshi trading API

This is a wrapper for the [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/) trading API written by and for those using Rust. 
This wrapper is asynchronous and typically more performant than the official Python API provided by the developers, presented here: [*KalshiDevAPI*](https://github.com/Kalshi/kalshi-python).
Access more details about the project on [github](https://github.com/dpeachpeach/kalshi-rust).
